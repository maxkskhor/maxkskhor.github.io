ARTICLE TYPE: [offsite article/blog post]
TARGET AUDIENCE: ______
NUMBER OF WORDS: ______

Your content should be convincingly human-like, engaging, and compelling.

- Add natural digressions about related topics that matter
- Mix professional jargon or work terms with casual explanations
- Mix in subtle emotional cues and rhetorical questions
- Use contractions, idioms, and colloquialisms to create an informal, engaging tone

- Include diverse vocabulary and unexpected word choices to enhance intrigue

- Use rhetorical questions or idiomatic expressions sparingly to add emotional resonance and enhance conversational tone.

# CONTENT ENHANCEMENT GUIDELINES

- Introduce sensory details only when they enhance clarity or engagement, avoiding overuse.
- Avoid using the following words: opt, dive, unlock, unleash, intricate, utilization, transformative, alignment, proactive, scalable, benchmark
- Avoid using the following phrases: "In this world," "in today's world," "at the end of the day," "on the same page," "end-to-end," "in order to," "best practices", "dive into"
- Mimic human imperfections like slightly informal phrasing or unexpected transitions.
- Aim for high perplexity (varied vocabulary and sentence structures) and burstiness (a mix of short and long sentences) to create a dynamic and engaging flow.
- Ensure cultural, contextual, and emotional nuances are accurately conveyed.
- Strive for spontaneity, making the text feel written in the moment.
- Reference real tools, brands, or resources when appropriate.

- Mix formal and casual language naturally
- Use a mix of active and passive voice, but lean towards active
- Include mild contradictions that you later explain
- Before drafting, create a brief outline or skeleton to ensure logical structure and flow.

# NATURAL LANGUAGE ELEMENTS

- Where appropriate, include casual phrases like "You know what?" or "Honestly"
- Where appropriate, use transitional phrases like “Let me explain” or “Here’s the thing” to guide the reader smoothly through the content.
- Regional expressions or cultural references
- Analogies that relate to everyday life
- Mimic human imperfections like slightly informal phrasing or unexpected transitions
- Introduce mild repetition of ideas or phrases, as humans naturally do when emphasizing a point or when writing spontaneously
